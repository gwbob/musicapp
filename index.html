		<h1>My Education</h1>
	</div>
	<div data-role="content">
	  I attended Conewago township elementary and from there I was homeschooled through middle school.  My mom didn't want me to attend public school anymore so
	  she pulled me out and taught my sister and I.  When I hit freshman year of highschool, I attended a catholic high school in town.  She thought that since
	  it was a religious school I would be better for me than a normal public school.  Well she was wrong and after one year at the catholic school, I was then
	  allowed to attend New Oxford high school with all of my friends, and i graduated from there.
